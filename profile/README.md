# 🩸 BerserkOS

**BerserkOS** is a high-performance, security-focused, Arch Linux-based operating system designed for hackers, developers, and digital warriors who live on the edge of control and chaos.

Modular by nature, BerserkOS lets you choose your weapon: XFCE, Openbox, Hyprland, or roll your own.
