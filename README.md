# 🩸 Berserk Arch

**Berserk Arch** is a high-performance, security-focused Linux distribution based on Arch Linux — built for hackers, red teamers, developers, power users, and digital warriors who want absolute control over their system and tools.

Minimal by default, modular by design, and unapologetically made to be broken, rebuilt, and mastered.

> “Crafted in blood, hardened in code.”

## 🧩 Repository Structure

Berserk Arch is built as a modular, GitOps-style ecosystem:

- [`berserk-core`](https://gitlab.com/berserkarch/berserk-core) – Base system files, hooks, branding, system tweaks
- [`berserk-pkg`](https://gitlab.com/berserkarch/berserk-pkg) – Custom PKGBUILDs, hacking tools, red team utilities
- [`berserk-profiles`](https://gitlab.com/berserkarch/berserk-profiles) – Desktop environment modules
  - `berserk-xfce` – Default profile, stable and pre-configured
  - `berserk-openbox` – Lightweight, fast, minimal
  - `berserk-hyprland` – Wayland-based, sleek, modern
  - _(GNOME planned, KDE intentionally excluded)_

## 🧠 Philosophy

Berserk Arch was never meant to be a general-purpose distro.

It’s built for those who:

- Customize everything
- Live in the terminal
- Understand the system inside-out
- Love bleeding-edge but demand stability
- Need hacking tools at their fingertips
- Think deeply, move fast, and break barriers

This is a distro for **those who find beauty in chaos and purpose in mastery.**

> “You don't just install Berserk Arch. You make it your own.”
